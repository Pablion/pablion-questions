# pablion-questions

A repo bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to show my questions. Faster than codesandbox?

## How to Use

- `yarn start` Runs the app in the development mode.
- Open [http://localhost:7345](http://localhost:7345) to view it in the browser.

### shortcuts

- MUI: Props of elements in ButtonGroup is changing style: http://localhost:7357/MUI_PCS

### There's not test yet

- So `yarn test` won't do anything.
